Library Management Client
Overview
Welcome to the Library Management Client, the frontend application for a robust library management system. This project offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface to manage books, members, and all essential library operations. Built with modern web technologies, it aims to streamline the processes of borrowing, returning, and cataloging books, making library administration efficient and accessible.

This client application works alongside a separate backend API (not included in this repository) to deliver full functionality.

Features
User Authentication & Authorization: Secure login and role-based access for librarians and administrators.

Book Management:

Add new books with details like title, author, ISBN, genre, and quantity.

View a comprehensive list of all available books.

Search and filter books using various criteria.

Update and delete book records.

Member Management:

Register new library members.

View and manage member profiles.

Search for members.

Update and delete member records.

Borrowing & Returning:

Streamlined process for issuing books to members.

Easy recording of book returns.

Track borrowed books and their due dates.

Intuitive User Interface: A clean and responsive design ensures a smooth experience across different devices.

Dashboard (Planned/Future): A quick overview of library statistics, popular books, and overdue items.

Technologies Used
React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

React Router DOM: For declarative routing in React applications.

Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

Tailwind CSS: (Assuming you're using Tailwind for styling) For rapid UI development and styling.

[Add any other major libraries/frameworks you've used, e.g., Redux, Context API, etc.]

Getting Started
Follow these steps to get your development environment up and running.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

Node.js (LTS version recommended)

npm or Yarn (npm is usually bundled with Node.js)

Installation
Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/rakibul561/library-management-client.git
cd library-management-client
Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install
# or
yarn install
Configuration
This client application needs a backend API to function correctly. You'll need to configure the API base URL.

Create a .env file in the root of your project:

REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=YOUR_BACKEND_API_URL
Replace YOUR_BACKEND_API_URL with the actual URL of your library management backend API. For example: http://localhost:5000/api or https://your-production-api.com/api.

Running the Application
To start the development server:

Bash

npm start
# or
yarn start
This will open the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000 (or another available port).
